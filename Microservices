Java microservices are a set of small, independent applications written in Java that work together to form a larger system. 
Each microservice has a specific, limited scope and runs in its own process, communicating with other services using lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging. 
Spring Boot, Jersey, and Swagger are some Popular Java frameworks used for building microservices
